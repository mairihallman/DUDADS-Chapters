	abstract     = {The problem of text mining has gained increasing attention in recent years because of the large amounts of text data, which are created in a variety of social network, web, and other information-centric applications. Unstructured data is the easiest form of data which can be created in any application scenario. As a result, there has been a tremendous need to design methods and algorithms which can effectively process a wide variety of text applications. This book will provide an overview of the different methods and algorithms which are common in the text domain, with a particular focus on mining methods.}
