Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his\/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nCompute the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$.\n    \n    ","prompt_answer":"Answer: 1680"},{"prompt":"Role: You are an advanced AI system with exceptional mathematical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, specifically designed to solve tricky math problems (whose answer is a non-negative integer) written in LaTeX format from the AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) competition.

For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write\n\n$$\nS_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)\n$$\n\nMore generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible. A possible signature is one that occurs for at least one $n$-label.\n\nIn this power question, you will be asked to analyze some of the properties of labels and signatures.\n\n\nWe can associate a shape to a given 2-signature: a diagram of up and down steps that indicates the relative order of adjacent numbers.

For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write\n\n$$\nS_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)\n$$\n\nMore generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible. A possible signature is one that occurs for at least one $n$-label.\n\nIn this power question, you will be asked to analyze some of the properties of labels and signatures.\n\n\nWe can associate a shape to a given 2-signature: a diagram of up and down steps that indicates the relative order of adjacent numbers.

In the case of an ideal coin, it is well-established that each flip has an equal $50 \\%$ chance of landing as either heads or tails.\nHowever, coin flips are not entirely random. They appear random to us because we lack sufficient information about the coin's initial conditions. If we possessed this information, we would always be able to predict the outcome without needing to flip the coin. For an intriguing discussion on why this observation is significant, watch this video by Vsauce.\n\nNow, consider a scenario where a coin with uniform density and negligible width is tossed directly upward from a height of $h=0.75 \\mathrm{~m}$ above the ground. The coin starts with its heads facing upward and is given an initial vertical velocity of $v_{y}=49 \\mathrm{~m} \/ \\mathrm{s}$ and a positive angular velocity of $\\omega=\\pi \\mathrm{rad} \/ \\mathrm{s}$. What face does the coin display upon hitting the ground? Submit $\\mathbf{0}$ for heads and $\\mathbf{1}$ for tails. You only have one attempt for this problem.

For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write\n\n$$\nS_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)\n$$\n\nMore generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible. A possible signature is one that occurs for at least one $n$-label.\n\nIn this power question, you will be asked to analyze some of the properties of labels and signatures.\n\n\nWe can associate a shape to a given 2-signature: a diagram of up and down steps that indicates the relative order of adjacent numbers.

In fact, about 700 years before Pascal, the Indian mathematician Halayudha wrote about it in his commentaries to a then-1000-year-old treatise on verse structure by the Indian poet and mathematician Pingala, who called it the Meruprast\u0101ra, or \"Mountain of Gems\". In this Power Question, we'll explore some properties of Pingala's\/Pascal's Triangle (\"PT\") and its variants.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, the only definition, notation, and formulas you may use for PT are the definition, notation, and formulas given below.\n\nPT consists of an infinite number of rows, numbered from 0 onwards. The $n^{\\text {th }}$ row contains $n+1$ numbers, identified as $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$, where $0 \\leq k \\leq n$. For all $n$, define $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, 0)=\\operatorname{Pa}(n, n)=1$. Then for $n>1$ and $1 \\leq k \\leq n-1$, define $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=\\mathrm{Pa}(n-1, k-1)+\\mathrm{Pa}(n-1, k)$. It is convenient to define $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=0$ when $kn$. We write the nonzero values of $\\mathrm{PT}$ in the familiar pyramid shown below.\n\n\n\nAs is well known, $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$ gives the number of ways of choosing a committee of $k$ people from a set of $n$ people, so a simple formula for $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$ is $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=\\frac{n !}{k !(n-k) !}$. You may use this formula or the recursive definition above throughout this Power Question.\n\nClark's Triangle: If the left side of PT is replaced with consecutive multiples of 6 , starting with 0 , but the right entries (except the first) and the generating rule are left unchanged, the result is called Clark's Triangle. If the $k^{\\text {th }}$ entry of the $n^{\\text {th }}$ row is denoted by $\\mathrm{Cl}(n, k)$, then the formal rule is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\\mathrm{Cl}(n, 0)=6 n & \\text { for all } n \\\\ \\mathrm{Cl}(n, n)=1 & \\text { for } n \\geq 1 \\\\ \\mathrm{Cl}(n, k)=\\mathrm{Cl}(n-1, k-1)+\\mathrm{Cl}(n-1, k) & \\text { for } n \\geq 1 \\text { and } 1 \\leq k \\leq n-1\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe first four rows of Clark's Triangle are given below.\n\n\nCompute $\\mathrm{Cl}(11,2)$.\n    \n    ","prompt_answer":"Answer: 1000"},{"prompt":"Role: You are an advanced AI system with exceptional mathematical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, specifically designed to solve tricky math problems (whose answer is a non-negative integer) written in LaTeX format from the AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) competition.

After robbing a bank, the Robber retreats to a network of hideouts, represented by dots in the diagram below. Every day, the Robber stays holed up in a single hideout, and every night, the Robber moves to an adjacent hideout. Two hideouts are adjacent if and only if they are connected by an edge in the diagram, also called a hideout map (or map). For the purposes of this Power Question, the map must be connected; that is, given any two hideouts, there must be a path from one to the other. To clarify, the Robber may not stay in the same hideout for two consecutive days, although he may return to a hideout he has previously visited. For example, in the map below, if the Robber holes up in hideout $C$ for day 1 , then he would have to move to $B$ for day 2 , and would then have to move to either $A, C$, or $D$ on day 3.\n\n\n\nEvery day, each Cop searches one hideout: the Cops know the location of all hideouts and which hideouts are adjacent to which. Cops are thorough searchers, so if the Robber is present in the hideout searched, he is found and arrested. If the Robber is not present in the hideout searched, his location is not revealed. That is, the Cops only know that the Robber was not caught at any of the hideouts searched; they get no specific information (other than what they can derive by logic) about what hideout he was in. Cops are not constrained by edges on the map: a Cop may search any hideout on any day, regardless of whether it is adjacent to the hideout searched the previous day. A Cop may search the same hideout on consecutive days, and multiple Cops may search different hideouts on the same day. In the map above, a Cop could search $A$ on day 1 and day 2, and then search $C$ on day 3 .\n\nThe focus of this Power Question is to determine, given a hideout map and a fixed number of Cops, whether the Cops can be sure of catching the Robber within some time limit.\n\nMap Notation: The following notation may be useful when writing your solutions. For a map $M$, let $h(M)$ be the number of hideouts and $e(M)$ be the number of edges in $M$. The safety of a hideout $H$ is the number of hideouts adjacent to $H$, and is denoted by $s(H)$.\n\nThe Cop number of a map $M$, denoted $C(M)$, is the minimum number of Cops required to guarantee that the Robber is caught.\nFind $C(M)$ for the map below.\n\n\n    \n    ","prompt_answer":"Answer: 6"},{"prompt":"Role: You are an advanced AI system with exceptional mathematical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, specifically designed to solve tricky math problems (whose answer is a non-negative integer) written in LaTeX format from the AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) competition.
