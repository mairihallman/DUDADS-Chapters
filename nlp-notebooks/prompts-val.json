In fact, about 700 years before Pascal, the Indian mathematician Halayudha wrote about it in his commentaries to a then-1000-year-old treatise on verse structure by the Indian poet and mathematician Pingala, who called it the Meruprast\u0101ra, or \"Mountain of Gems\". In this Power Question, we'll explore some properties of Pingala's\/Pascal's Triangle (\"PT\") and its variants.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, the only definition, notation, and formulas you may use for PT are the definition, notation, and formulas given below.\n\nPT consists of an infinite number of rows, numbered from 0 onwards. The $n^{\\text {th }}$ row contains $n+1$ numbers, identified as $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$, where $0 \\leq k \\leq n$. For all $n$, define $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, 0)=\\operatorname{Pa}(n, n)=1$. Then for $n>1$ and $1 \\leq k \\leq n-1$, define $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=\\mathrm{Pa}(n-1, k-1)+\\mathrm{Pa}(n-1, k)$. It is convenient to define $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=0$ when $kn$. We write the nonzero values of $\\mathrm{PT}$ in the familiar pyramid shown below.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2023_12_21_b0415e12b85f62aa86deg-1.jpg?height=420&width=1201&top_left_y=1015&top_left_x=473)\n\nAs is well known, $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$ gives the number of ways of choosing a committee of $k$ people from a set of $n$ people, so a simple formula for $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$ is $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=\\frac{n !}{k !(n-k) !}$. You may use this formula or the recursive definition above throughout this Power Question.\n\nClark's Triangle: If the left side of PT is replaced with consecutive multiples of 6 , starting with 0 , but the right entries (except the first) and the generating rule are left unchanged, the result is called Clark's Triangle. If the $k^{\\text {th }}$ entry of the $n^{\\text {th }}$ row is denoted by $\\mathrm{Cl}(n, k)$, then the formal rule is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\\mathrm{Cl}(n, 0)=6 n & \\text { for all } n \\\\ \\mathrm{Cl}(n, n)=1 & \\text { for } n \\geq 1 \\\\ \\mathrm{Cl}(n, k)=\\mathrm{Cl}(n-1, k-1)+\\mathrm{Cl}(n-1, k) & \\text { for } n \\geq 1 \\text { and } 1 \\leq k \\leq n-1\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe first four rows of Clark's Triangle are given below.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2023_12_21_c41919b703ea0b966244g-1.jpg?height=412&width=1152&top_left_y=1602&top_left_x=476)\nCompute $\\mathrm{Cl}(11,3)$.\n    \n    ","prompt_answer":"Answer: 2025"},{"prompt":"Role: You are an advanced AI system with exceptional mathematical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, specifically designed to solve tricky math problems (whose answer is a non-negative integer) written in LaTeX format from the AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) competition.

After solving, create an \"Answer\" section where you will state only the final integer answer, without any additional text or narrative.\n    \n    Problem: An $\\boldsymbol{n}$-label is a permutation of the numbers 1 through $n$. For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write\n\n$$\nS_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)\n$$\n\nMore generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible. A possible signature is one that occurs for at least one $n$-label.\n\nIn this power question, you will be asked to analyze some of the properties of labels and signatures.\n\n\nWe can associate a shape to a given 2-signature: a diagram of up and down steps that indicates the relative order of adjacent numbers.

Ross wishes to place an identical gift on each of $k$ plates, so that no two neighbouring plates have gifts. Let $f(n, k)$ represent the number of ways in which he can place the gifts. For example $f(6,3)=2$, as shown below.\n\n\nThroughout this problem, we represent the states of the $n$ plates as a string of 0's and 1's (called a binary string) of length $n$ of the form $p_{1} p_{2} \\cdots p_{n}$, with the $r$ th digit from the left (namely $p_{r}$ ) equal to 1 if plate $r$ contains a gift and equal to 0 if plate $r$ does not. We call a binary string of length $n$ allowable if it satisfies the requirements - that is, if no two adjacent digits both equal 1. Note that digit $p_{n}$ is also \"adjacent\" to digit $p_{1}$, so we cannot have $p_{1}=p_{n}=1$.\nDetermine the value of $f(7,3)$.\n    \n    ","prompt_answer":"Answer: 7"},{"prompt":"Role: You are an advanced AI system with exceptional mathematical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, specifically designed to solve tricky math problems (whose answer is a non-negative integer) written in LaTeX format from the AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) competition.
