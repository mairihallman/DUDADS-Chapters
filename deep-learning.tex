\section{A Brief Overview of Tensors}

You are likely familiar with scalars, vectors, and matrices. These can be thought of as analagous data structures in zero, one, and two-dimensions, respectively. When generalizing to \(N\) dimensions, we refer to these collectively as tensors. A scalar is a zero-order tensor, a vector is a first-order tensor, and a matrix is a second-order tensor. A third-order tensor can be visualized as a stack of matrices. A fourth-order tensor would then be a vector of third order tensors. A fifth-order tensor is a matrix of third-order tensors... and so on.

\subsection{Tensor Products}

Tensor additon and subtraction are self-explanatory if matrix addition and subtraction are understood. The same cannot be said for tensor products. Below is an overview of important tensor products.
